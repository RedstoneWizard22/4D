This repo is currently in limbo. It started as a project to visualise 4D shapes, and still is structured that way. However it's slowly morphing into being a monorepo for my entire site [rwizard22.com](https://rwizard22.com). For now nothing notable has been completed, but you can visit [my test site](https://4d-alpha.vercel.app) in the meantime to get a peek at what I'm working on if you're interested :)
